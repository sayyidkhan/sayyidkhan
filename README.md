### Hi there 👋
I am a full-stack software engineer. Once upon a time, i was a nobody and not
trained in the IT industry. I started my first job as a graphics designer and
not knowing what i want in my life and career.

After going through singapore army (national service), the time i spent there
gave me the perspective that i like to build products. I felt that there is 
more scalability in my career to learn front-end development since i was
inclined towards design at the point of time. Later on, i realised that more
value and features can be introduced by adding a backend to your application.

Thats when I started to learn backend programming language, python was my first
backend language i worked with then later on node.js.

Before i know it, i landed a job in software engineering doing full-stack development
in java springboot and anuglar on the frontend.

And that's all folks.
